I would like to transform my MK6 TSI into a Golf 6R fused with a 7.5R look, by putting on 6R bodykit and installing 7.5R lights plus enterior. I recently got the vehicle, so will be crossing off mechanical issues before I do the actual cosmetics mods. Below are some of the ideas I have in mind.

    </div>
