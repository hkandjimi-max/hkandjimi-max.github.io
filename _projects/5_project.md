The Ford Ranger (T6) was introduce to me around 2014, a few years just after it's launch in Namibia and I automaticaly impress by it's looks - there was so much to play with on this models.

Following my limited budget, I bought my vehicle base or even lower then base - I only had a radio and A/C plus the paintwork and metals welded together  of course.

   Frame 1 is how I got the car from <a href="https://facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/NovelFordWindhoek1?mibextid=LQQJ4d" title="Facebook">Novel Ford Windoek</a>, "Showroom condition " they said, following my pocket. Well frame 2 was the first modification I did which was just branding it with my name and upgraded to 16" Mag rims, then took a long desert trip from Windhoek through the Naukluft park to swakop the down the Skeleton Coast, some how end up in my home town - Rundu.
</div>

Next was rebranding the car back to a Ranger and upgrade on the rims as well as wheel spaces. This gave the car a buff look and more aggressive on the road, despite the noise from the wide tyres. The decals were custom designed by myself and had then done by a print shop.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

After this I took out the car for some mud fun and a bit of off road play, collected a cow and had braai afterwards ..probably on a different day though.

Due to all the rough driving with the bakkie with wide wheels, most of my center caps were damaged or had fallen off. My next approach was to design center caps with my company logo and have it printed with a 3D printer - came out clean like I imagened.

    The final product fitted on the rims - should have repainted the rims too.

Finally I got the car resprayed and put on much better raptor decals - then sold it, I was done with this project and there seemed to be no mo ideas. Items not included the list above are the upgrade on the radio to an Android Infotainment Unit, Reverse Camera, Dynamic Turn signals on mirrors and LED lights for both the front and back. Below is a final look at the vehicle.
