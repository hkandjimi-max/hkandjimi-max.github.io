        "Child-based disappearances; abuse and suicides are still a predominant dilemma in Namibia, with the majority of the cases resulting from poor parental supervision. Accordingly, there is a need for alternative ways to supervise children, especially during outdoor activities where the chances of them wandering far from home are quite high. The immediate objective of this research was to design and develop an android-based supervisory tracking system for children in Namibia, as a means to improve parental supervision. In addition to the geo-tracking component, an audio sentiment analysis features to predict the likely hood of depression signs in children was integrated. This study used spatial data, like global position system (GPS) coordinates and utilized text-based data provided by Google’s speech-to-text feature. The GPS coordinates were captured using an inbuilt GPS module within the tracking device.",

This literature review delves into the realm of automated hint generation, a promising approach that could revolutionize the way feedback is provided in programming education. The paper explores various methods and frameworks, with a particular emphasis on automated directive feedback via hint generation, finding ITAP [25] as the most effective hint generation technique surveyed. The review also examines the capabilities of generative AI models in generating hints and their potential to enhance the hint-generation process. The effectiveness of directive feedback is evaluated, highlighting its benefits in providing students with a clear path towards a correct solution, but also its potential drawbacks in hindering student learning when overused. This review provides valuable insights into the current state of automated hint generation and offers directions for future research.",

        "The continuous growth of source code adds scalability and performance constraints to analysis and similarity detection applications. Abstract syntax tree (AST) representations enable accurate detec- tion of similarities between source codes based on the structural composition. Many have investigated specific optimisations using ASTs to detect code clones and similarities. However, a common concept arises in determining the optimal tradeoff between perfomance and accuracy within similarity detection and clustering. This projects explores the generation of ASTs, the effects of processing data derived from ASTs, and the clustering techniques utilised with the relevant datasets. A review of related literature has identified correlations between vectorising the AST data and the popularity of partitioning-based clustering techniques.",
