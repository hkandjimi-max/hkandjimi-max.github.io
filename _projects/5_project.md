The Ford Ranger (T6) was introduced to me around 2014, a few years just after its launch in Namibia and I was automatically impressed by its looks - there was so much to play with on this model.

Following my limited budget, I bought my vehicle base or even lower than the base - I only had a radio and A/C plus the paintwork and metals welded together of course.

   Frame 1 is how I got the car from <a href="https://facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/NovelFordWindhoek1?mibextid=LQQJ4d" title="Facebook">Novel Ford Windoek</a>, "Showroom condition " they said, following my pocket. Well, frame 2 was the first modification I did which was just branding it with my name and upgrading to 16" Mag rims, then took a long desert trip from Windhoek through the Naukluft park to Swakop then down the Skeleton Coast, somehow ended up in my home town - Rundu.
</div>

Next was rebranding the car back to a Ranger and upgrading the rims as well as wheel spaces. This gave the car a buff look and more aggressive on the road, despite the noise from the wide tires. The decals were custom-designed by myself and then had them done by a print shop.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

After this, I took out the car for some mud fun and a bit of off-road play, collected a cow and had braai afterward..probably on a different day though.

Due to all the rough driving with the bakkie with wide wheels, most of my center caps were damaged or had fallen off. My next approach was to design center caps with my company logo and have them printed with a 3D printer - came out clean like I imagined.

    The final product fitted on the rims - should have had the rims resprayed too.
</div>
Finally, I got the car resprayed and put on much better raptor decals - then sold it, I was done with this project and there seemed to be no more ideas. Items not included in the list above are the upgrade on the radio to an Android Infotainment Unit, Reverse Camera, Dynamic Turn signals on mirrors and LED lights for both the front and back. Below is a final look at the vehicle.
