Herman advocates for active reading in homes, sports participation and promotes innovation and entrepreneurship in the community. In the last few years, his studies have been spread through three main fields- Education, Business and Computer Science. Starting off with a Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education, to a Master in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering and then lately a Postgraduate Diploma in Management aim at improving managerial competencies in business acumen, performance management and organizational culture. See [CV page](/cv/) for detailed information.

Born and raised at Namutuntu, a small village along the Kavango River in the northern part of Namibia - Herman took an interest in technology in his first year of High school. At Elcin Nkurenkuru High School, he was introduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">LOGO</a> (A general-purpose programming language, widely known for its use of turtle graphics, in which commands for movement and drawing produced lines or vector graphics) and this launched his career in Computer Science. After high school Herman, pursued a BSc in Information Technology majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the University of Cape Town which he graduated in 2009. Upon graduation, he briefly worked in industry but ended up in the Education sector under Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) which accelerated his academic and landed him at the Namibia University of Science and Technology - then Polytechnic of Namibia in 2014.

During the weekends, Herman can be found doing casual 10 KM runs following any available trail or occasionally joining organized marathons in whichever city he finds himself in. Ideally, the remaining part of the weekend is for Car projects and Business errands.
