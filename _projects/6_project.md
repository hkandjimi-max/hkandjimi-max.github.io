Following the T6 Success, I bought a T7 XLS double cab due to it's height aaand sort of the perfomance with an aim to replicate the full Raptor look. However, my plan was to save on buying the car and spend on cutomization -WORST MISTAKE EVER!!. Bought the car second hand of a dealer and they were not up front with the car issues. After getting it only noticeable  issues was the AC, so got this sorted and did my first cosmetics uprade - windshields, light covers and even threw in LED taillights,nextgen style.

But boy, was I in for a ride, the vehicle started having issues first with the brakes, then clutch and eventually the engine gave in and warranty was only offering 35% cover. Well in the time I had it there was fun and below are some mods I did.
